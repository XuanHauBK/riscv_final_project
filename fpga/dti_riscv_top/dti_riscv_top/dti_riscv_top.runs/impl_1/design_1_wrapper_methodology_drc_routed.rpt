LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/mdm_0/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) design_1_i/mdm_0/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_cpu_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_cpu_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_cpu_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_cpu_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1]

Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
